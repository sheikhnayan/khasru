Within that scope Docmerit may for instance require a judicial decision of a competent court in the United States, whose decision demonstrates that the Study Material concerned is manifestly unlawful. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">8.7</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;By issuing a notice you indemnify Docmerit against any claim of third parties with regard to removing or making inaccessible the Study Material and/or the provision of the name, address and place of residence of the user who sent the notice. Such indemnification also covers all the damage that Docmerit suffers and the costs it incurs in relation to such a claim, including - but not limited to - reimbursing the costs of legal assistance. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">8.8</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Docmerit will not in any way whatsoever be a party to any dispute between the party that issued the notice and the other party.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c3">Article 9.
